# Client server interaction via socket example

## Disclaimer

Due to the requirements are not written clearly I have implemented the project on `net.Socket` instead of `socket.io`.
Also, I decided to use `fp-ts` and `typescript` because I've not seen any restriction in the requirements.
I understand that some functions are hard to read for not experienced developers.

Many edge cases were skipped. The implementation is pretty simple. 

## How to run

**real word**

```shell
npm i
npm run build
npm run start-server
npm run start-client
```

**Unit and integration tests**
```shell
npm run test
```
